# Overview

Do you want to set up a development enviroment for a new AngularJS web application but you hate all that initial work? With this archetype you will have all the basic tools for getting a simple AngularJS app up and running with just a few steps.

* Clone this repository
* Open up a terminal/command line tool, navigate to the root folder of the repository and execute `npm install`
* Prepare the dist folder executing `grunt dev`
* Launch the development web server executing `grunt start-server`
* Your default web browser will open up your new web application. Enjoy!

**NOTE:** You will need the following thrid-party software in order to be able to run all the commands:

* [Node Package Manager](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)
* [Grunt CLI](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/install)

## Future work

Of course, I know this information is not enough at all. In the following days (or weeks) I will be improving this archetype and the documentation in order to make it usable in real world applications. Stay tuned ;)
